"""Build locality-ordered backward task tables and their CTA walk on the device.

One JIT issues four launches: work scan, segment keys, bin scan, table scatter. Forward buckets have
ascending queries and contiguous (head, query window, key block) segments, so
``offsets[segment] + task - first_tasks[segment]`` reproduces the Torch reference order kept in
``tests/functional_tests/models/minimax_m3_vl/test_msa_task_build_sm100.py``. Noncontiguous segments
keep source order (descriptor flag 2). Capacity overflow disables the CTA walk (flag 1). Exact task
counts and the walk stay on the device; the host launches a grid bound and surplus CTAs take empty
intervals.
